# This script is used to build and copy the Angular 2 based vtctld UI
# into the release folder (app) for checkin. Prior to running this script,
# bootstrap.sh and bootstrap_web.sh should already have been run.


# This script expects release names to follow the upstream release naming
# scheme, but Slack has our own naming scheme. Updating the logic to
# parse Slack release names became a rabbit hole I want to defer.
#
# I will hardcode the previous Slack release here because it is static.
